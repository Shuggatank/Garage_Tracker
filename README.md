This project is just one part of a two part project. This backend API holds the data for the garage.
Data can be written to and read from the database from the front end component of the project. 
The user would be able to store their vehicle data such as make, model, year, as well as VIN. 
Each vehicle can contain records of work done on the vehicle such as oil changes, gas fill ups, 
and any other maintenance records.
